# Maze Solve

This is a programme code for solving a maze using recursive function calls. The content of the function onemove, which performs a recall call, is something like: if it can move one square in either direction, it moves one square in that direction, and if it cannot move, it terminates the function.

To change the maze to solve, change the file name at line 26 of "main.c".
